# Useful Git Commands

Here's a collection of Git commands I find myself using frequently.

## Daily Commands

```bash
# View status
git status

# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-branch

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```

## Advanced Commands

```bash
# Interactive rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Force push safely
git push --force-with-lease

# Clean untracked files
git clean -fd
```

## Tips

1. Always use `--force-with-lease` instead of `--force`
2. Use conventional commit messages
3. Keep commits atomic and focused
